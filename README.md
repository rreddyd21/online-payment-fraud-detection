# 💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Summary

Developed a **machine learning–based fraud detection system** to identify fraudulent online payment transactions. The model analyzes transaction patterns and classifies payments as **fraudulent or legitimate**, helping financial systems reduce fraud risk and monetary loss.

---

## Problem Statement

Online payment systems are highly vulnerable to fraud due to increasing digital transactions. Traditional rule-based systems fail to adapt to new fraud patterns. This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to automatically detect fraudulent transactions with higher accuracy.

* Detect fraudulent online payment transactions
* Improve fraud detection accuracy using ML models
* Reduce false positives in transaction classification
* Analyze transaction behavior patterns

---

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:**

  * NumPy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn
